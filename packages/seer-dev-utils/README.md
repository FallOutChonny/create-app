# seer-dev-utils

This package includes some utilities used by [create-seer-app](https://github.com/falloutchonny/create-seer-app).<br>

## Usage in Create Seer App Projects

These utilities come by default with [Create Serr App](https://github.com/falloutchonny/create-seer-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create Seer App projects.**

## Usage Outside of Create Seer App

If you don’t use Create Seer App, you may keep using these utilities. Their development will be aligned with Create Seer App, so major versions of these utilities may come out relatively often. 

### Entry Points

There is no single entry point. You can only import individual top-level modules.
